# homework0
This assignment is due this Friday September 1st by 11:59pm.

For homework 0 you will write a Quarto document that generates an html with the solutions to $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ for $a = 1, b = 3, c = 2$. The report should include a plot confirming the result. The html report should not show the code, but the code must be in the Quarto document. The document should include explanations of what the reader is seeing but should be no longer than 1 page.

The document should be written so that if the grader changes a, b, and c and renders the document, the resulting report will be correct. Your code should properly deal with the fact that there could be 0, 1 or 2 solutions.
